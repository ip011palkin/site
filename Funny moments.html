        <h2>Funny moments</h2>
        <h3>2011/07/01 - 2011/09/30</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>1</h5>
        <h7>Let it not be in the time gap but you should know. Summer 2010, a user posted a message on the Bitcointalk forum offering to buy two pizzas for 10,000 BTC, which was worth about $41 at the time. The user found someone to take them up on the offer, and the transaction became known as the "Bitcoin Pizza Day" and is now celebrated every year on May 22.</h7>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>2</h5>
        <h7>During the first Bitcoin conference held in New York City, attendees were able to purchase tickets with Bitcoin. However, due to a technical glitch, some attendees received tickets to a New York Yankees game instead of the conference.</h7>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>3</h5>
        <h7>In July 2011, a user on the BitcoinTalk forum claimed to have lost 25,000 BTC due to a problem with the Bitcoin wallet software. This was worth around $250,000 at the time, but would be worth over $1 billion in today's prices. This incident highlighted the need for secure storage solutions for Bitcoin.</h7>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>4</h5>
        <h7>In August 2011, an attacker exploited a vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol that allowed them to generate 184 billion BTC. The attacker quickly reported the bug and the issue was resolved, but it was a humorous moment for some in the community who joked about becoming billionaires overnight.</h7>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>5</h5>
        <h7>Some people who tried to mine Bitcoin using their laptops reported that the process made their computers overheat and catch fire, resulting in some humorous (but potentially dangerous) situations.</h7>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>6</h5>
        <h7>There were also a number of funny memes and jokes that circulated within the community, poking fun at everything from the volatility of the market to the technical complexities of using the technology. For example, the phrase "To the moon!" became a popular catchphrase among bitcoiners, symbolizing their belief in the future potential of the currency.</h7>
